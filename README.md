## Nima-Cpp
Nima C++ Runtime Library

## Building
Currently contains a single Makefile that has been tested on OSX. The library is self contained so porting to other environments shouldn't be too difficult. It's on the list :) 

## Usage
Take a look at https://github.com/2d-inc/Nima-Cpp-Testing for an example implementation.
